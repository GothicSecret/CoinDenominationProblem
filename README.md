# CoinDenominationProblem
Excercise for Interview Candidates

At the direction of the current administration, the U.S. Treasury has instituted a highly efficient, cost-saving measure to minimize the various types of coin and currency currently in circulation. After consultation with numerous well-studied people with PhD’s, the decision has been made to eliminate all paper currency, and mint coins in only denominations of $0.04, $0.05, and $0.07. The various PhD’s have decreed that the coins thus minted will be more durable than paper currency, and can be combined to total any amount over $0.04. 

In an additional effort to stimulate economic growth, the current administration, acting in concert with a friendly congressional majority, has further decreed that the minimum price for any good or service, throughout the land, shall be $0.07, and that all purchases are to be made in the exact amount due. No change shall be given. Because, efficiency.

The upshot of all this is that for any purchase, one need simply determine the correct combination of these three denominations of coin which total the purchase amount. 


John Ockers, a die hard fan of ‘90s pop-punk, has gone and picked out a selection of CD’s by his favorite bands of the era, the total cost of of the purchase being $31.89. 

Are the government PhD’s correct? Can this system possibly work?

Using the newly minted coins, how can he determine the correct combination of coin in order to make his purchase?
